# SARS-CoV-2-receptor-binding-domain-ACE2-receptor-
 return fasta sequences of SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain
and perform a multiple sequence alignment on the fasta seqs returned from function A. Identify highly conserved regions that may be the result of similarities and relationships between the sequences.
Perform blastP where each sequence returned from the function A is blasted against the BLAST DB 'AllSurfaceGlycoproteinSeqs'
Analyze the data to look for differences between the RBD and the sequence.
Interpret BLAST Results.
